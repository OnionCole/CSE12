Instructions on How to Run Any Code or Simulations:
1. Open Lab2.lgi in "MultiMedia Logic"
2. Navigate to the first page of circuits
3. Press the play button
4. Press clear button to clear registers to zero values.
5. Click a button on the keypad to fill the value in the keypad output display. With the sel switch set to 0, press the update button to alter the value of the register corresponding to the write register address as given by the write register address switches.
6. With the sel switch set to 1, press the update button to alter the value of the register corresponding to the write register address as given by the write register address switches, changing the value to the output of the bitwise left circle operation of the ALU input 1 value, as given by the read register 1 address switches, circled by the value of the ALU input 2 value, as given by the read register 2 address switches.
